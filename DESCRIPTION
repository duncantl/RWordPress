Package: RWordPress
Version: 1.0.0
Title: R interface to WordPress.
Description: This is a package that provides a programmatic interface to
  access WordPress blogs using XMLRPC. It has been forked from Duncan Temple
  Long's original RWordPress interface. It must maintain the RWordPress name
  in order to work properly with knit2wp.
  Using the login and password for a blog, one can both query and post to a
  blog. One can query the pages, posts, categories, dates of the posts, etc.
  One can create new pages or posts on a given page and even upload files
  to the blog.
  This is an illustration of XML-RPC within R and also a useful facility for
  people blogging about R and wanting to create content within R and post it to the
  blog. However we prepare the content (e.g. directly, or with Sweave or XDynDocs or XSL)
  we can the post that content. We might also create some facilities for taking an existing
  post and inserting R content at places based on ids or stubs. This would allow people
  to create the post using an editor, e.g. Wordpress's own interface and the populate the
  content with R output.
